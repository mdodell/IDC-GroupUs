# IDC-GroupUs
GroupUs is a website built with PHP, JQuery and JavaScript which allows both individuals and groups to register for events. It exports all information from the users into an Excel file, which is emailed to the user and any acting registrar(s). The registrar(s) can also access a panel to view all Excel files and requested variables.

The idea originated within the CS11A class at Brandeis University, and was developed to be used by the Interact District Council in Rotary District 5495 for their annual Interact District Conference. 

Potential future endeavors with it include transitioning it into a hub for customizable forms for organizationâ€™s events, and customizable CSS designs.
